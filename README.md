- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ARzRehman
- Third-year Business Student, 
passionate about web development 
and web technologies, future Project Manager,
 Business Leader and a Business Consultant. 
My passion for business and information technology
brought me to the Institute of Business and Information Technology PU,Lahore, 
where I am improving my skills and working on small 
projects to showcase that skills. 

Last month, I took admission in Project Management certification by Google on Coursera,
which covers the foundation and four phases(initiating, planning, executing, and closing) of project management. 
This will help me in my career to strengthen 
my skills.

The most valuable lesson I have learned from my student and professional life 
has been the importance of learning every day,
 building connections and giving back to community.
 Even though I knew I wanted to be a Business Consultant, 
I have enjoyed working in the field of Project Management, Leadership and IT. 

This year I also have learned some technical skills like WordPress, Digital Marketing, and HTML. 
I continue to build skills in Marketing,Web Development and SEO. 

Next year, I hope to get a job that will provide 
real-life experience and important technological skills.
